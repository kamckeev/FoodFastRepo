Group Project III

Michael Levandoski, Anna Brown, Cristian Salazar, Kim McKeever

Group Summary:A dataset with fast food restaurants and their latitude and longitude coordinates was obtained on Kaggle.com.  This data set will be used to generate a marker cluster layer on a map, or a heat map of fast food locations in the US to visualize the concentration of locations for the first visualization of the presentation.

A second visualization will be a side by side comparison of density of fast food restaurants and number of patients with heart disease.

Finally, an electronic survey will be sent to the class that will be used to generate a tree chart, or a sunburst chart to display the favorite fast food restaurants as well asfavorite items on the respective menus for the class.
